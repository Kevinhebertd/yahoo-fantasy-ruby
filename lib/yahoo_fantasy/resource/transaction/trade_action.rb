      # get by asking the transactions collection for all pending trades for your team, you can choose to
      # accept or reject it.

      # If there are accepted trades in your league waiting to be processed, which you can get by asking the
      # transactions collection for all pending trades for your team, and youâ€™re the commissioner of a league
      # that has the commissioner approve trades, you can choose to allow or disallow the trade.
